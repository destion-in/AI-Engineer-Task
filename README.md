# AI Intern Task: Health Data Trend Prediction Model

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict health trends based on historical health data. This task involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, evaluation, and optionally deployment.

## Task Overview

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Source**: Utilize the provided healthcare dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset), which includes metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, HRV, and temperature.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might improve model performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Visualization**: Generate plots to understand the distribution and trends of the health metrics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests to understand relationships between different health metrics.

### 3. Model Selection and Training
- **Model Selection**: Research and select appropriate machine learning algorithms for time series prediction.
- **Model Training**: Split the data into training and testing sets and train the model on the training set.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to evaluate the model performance.
- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

### 5. Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze the importance of different features and refine the model accordingly.

### 6. Optional: Model Deployment
- **Deployment Strategy**: Develop a strategy to deploy the model, either locally or on a cloud platform.
- **API Integration**: Create an API endpoint to serve the model predictions.

### 7. Documentation and Reporting
- **Documentation**: Document the entire process, including data preprocessing steps, EDA findings, model selection rationale, and evaluation results.
- **Reporting**: Prepare a report summarizing the project, insights, and model performance.

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- EDA report with visualizations and statistical analysis
- Trained machine learning model
- Evaluation metrics and cross-validation results
- Optimized model with hyperparameters
- (Optional) Deployed model with API endpoint
- Comprehensive documentation and project report
